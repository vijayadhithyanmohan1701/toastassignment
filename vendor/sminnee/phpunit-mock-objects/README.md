# PHPUnit_MockObject

**PHPUnit_MockObject** is the default mock object library for PHPUnit.

**This is a fork of the original project to provide support for newer PHP versions to PHPUnit 5.**

## Requirements

* PHP 5.6 is required but using the latest version of PHP is highly recommended

## Installation

You can add this library as a local, per-project dependency to your project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

    composer require phpunit/phpunit-mock-objects

If you only need this library during development, for instance to run your project's test suite, then you should add it as a development-time dependency:

    composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit-mock-objects
